--> C. 5 Concurrency in Action

Memory model
    There are two aspects to it:
        - The structural
        - The concurrency

Modification order
    An object has a modification order that comprises all the writes to such object
    in the execution of the program
    If we use atomics, it is up to the compiler that such synchronization is taken place


DOUBTS
    - So does that mean that atomics are compile-time memory synchronization
      in contrast to using locks?
