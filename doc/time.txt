    consist of an epoch time (starting time point)
    and a tick rate

time points
    Duration of time that passed since an specific clock epoch
    + clock's epoch
    + duration
durations
    Span of times, a number of ticks
    Ex. 42 seconds can be represented as 42 ticks of 1 second

    It just stores the number of ticks, the period is a compile-time
    constant

    takes a clock to get its
        Clock::duration
        Clock::duration::rep
        Clock::duration::period
    constructed by taking other's duration
    
    a clock normally passes in its duration
